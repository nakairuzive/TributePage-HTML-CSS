            <h2>Obituary</h2>
            <p>"In remembrance and celebration of the life of a legend, our beloved grandmother and great-grandmother, Sharai Marimira nee Chiminya (Mbuya VaMagumbo), the 4th child of the late mbuya Shingairai Mawere Dziva and sekuru Dhefu Ltd & Co Chiminya. Mbuya passed on peacefully on the 15th of September 2024 at approximately  09h00 am at Flame Lily Clinic at Gutu. She was 78 and 10 days away from turning  79. Mbuya vaMagumbo was born in Bako Village, where she attended primary school.

In her teenage years, she assumed the role of a mother after her aunt passed away, whom she was named after. It was no doubt challenging parenting children who were like her siblings. She did her best with the help and mentorship of her mother-in-law, the late Mbuya vaMukaro. She loved her mother-in-law. Her mother-in-law loved her too. Their relationship was a cherished bond—one of mutual respect and love—and in life as in death, they rest side by side.

Mbuya was a devoted member of the Reformed Church in Zimbabwe (RCZ), where she served in many leadership roles, including being a Deaconess and a leader in the Women's Fellowship (Sungano YaMadzimai).  Her faith in God was the anchor that sustained her and made her cope with the challenges of life. She was a mentally strong character. Her mantra to everything was, “hazvina mhaka tinonyengetera Mwari vanotiitira zvakanaka”. For any life challenge she could not resolve herself, prayer was her response.  Mbuya was also gifted with the ability to be outspoken and truthful to confront anything she believed was unjust.  

Socially, Mbuya was a loving and caring mother, grandmother, great-grandmother, aunt, sister, friend neighbour. Many found this place -Farm No. 110 - her home, lovely and welcoming because of her presence. 
VaMagumbo was generous, kind-hearted, and selfless. No one would pass by without being offered something to drink or eat. She generously gave out of whatever she had, and she never lacked anything. Whatever she had was enough for her! In this life, she was materially rich and lived a life of deep gratitude. She is even richer in God’s kingdom. She was the epitome of the virtuous woman described by Proverbs 31.

Moreover, she was a jack of all trades - a great farmer, just like her late husband, who trained her. She also trained, qualified and was a certified Master Farmer in her own right. People from far and wide survived from her harvests. Through hard work, she raised the family and educated her children well. She was a good cheerleader, listener, teacher and disciplinarian, often with a no-nonsense approach. 
With her unwavering dedication to her loved ones, she prayed for us all, calling each one by name. She taught us the importance of love, prayer, family and living life truthfully. Through her life, many lives were transformed, and lives will continue to be transformed if we all embrace her teachings, values and the exemplary life she led.

Mbuya departed unannounced. She surprised us. Vakatisiya ne sepu chaiyo as she would call it. We would have wanted to say goodbye, but God planned otherwise and spared her from long illnesses and suffering typical of the elderly. At its prime, God collected his flower! 

Mbuya will be remembered for her unique calling cord when she was in the fields, paddock, and granary, “huuuuuuu”. 

May her soul rest in eternal peace.  
Zororai murugare rwaShe wenyu vaGutu. Ticha sanganiswa zvekare!
